# 🧠 Memory Game

## 📄 Description
A classic tile-matching game designed to practice and demonstrate advanced DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic in JavaScript. The challenge involved implementing a mechanism to correctly match pairs, track moves, and handle the asynchronous timing of card flips.

## 🛠️ Technologies
* **HTML5 & CSS3:** For game structure and basic styling/layout.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** Core game logic, including card shuffling, click handlers, state management (checking for matches), and timing functions (`setTimeout`).
